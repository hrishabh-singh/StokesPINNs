# Stokes Flow PINNs Project

This folder contains all the data, figures, and scripts for the project on reproducing and analyzing results for Stokes flow using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

## Project Structure

- **data**  
  Contains history for all the training runs as CSV files.

- **figures**  
  Stores generated plots and visualizations of results.
  
- **notebook**  
  Includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and figure generation.

- **errors.xlsx**  
  Rel. $L_2$ errors for all modifications.
  
The work has utilized [JAX-PI][https://github.com/PredictiveIntelligenceLab/jaxpi] for the generation of all the modified models, their training and evaluation.
